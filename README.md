# IDS_ensemble
 This code to implement the framework of the paper "Cybersecurity attacks detection in Ensemble Learning Network systems".
 Firstly, clone the repositry, then, it need to download the datasets file into your machine in the IDS_ensemble directory.
 1- SDN dataset is already in the repositry.
 2- Download the NSL-KDD dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd
 3- Download the CICIDS2017 dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/cicids2017
 To run the phase two for each dataset, run the following code.
 resnet_sdn_split.py  (for SDN dataset).
 resnet_nsl_split.py  (for NSL dataset).
 resnet_cicids2017_split.py   (for CICIDS2017 dataset).
