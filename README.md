# IDS_ensemble
 This code to implement the framework of the paper "Cybersecurity attacks detection in Ensemble Learning Network systems".<br />
 Firstly, clone the repositry, then, download the datasets files into your machine in the IDS_ensemble directory.<br />
 <br />
 1- SDN dataset is already in the repositry.<br />
 2- Download the NSL-KDD dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd  <br />
 3- Download the CICIDS2017 dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/cicids2017 <br />
 To run phase one, run the following code. <br />
 <br />
 phase1_ddos_sdn.py  (for SDN dataset). <br />
 phase1_nsl.py  (for NSL dataset). <br />
 phase1_CICIDS2017.py   (for CICIDS2017 dataset). <br />

 
 To run the phase two for each dataset, run the following code. <br />
 <br />
 resnet_sdn_split.py  (for SDN dataset). <br />
 resnet_nsl_split.py  (for NSL dataset). <br />
 resnet_cicids2017_split.py   (for CICIDS2017 dataset). <br />
